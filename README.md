A simple to use DAO governance analytics dashboard with a beautiful visualization that leverages [Boardroom's API](https://www.boardroom.info/) to make it easier for people to learn about and analyze governance data.

Proposal Page => The user can see all of the proposal data: title, current state, description, start date, end date, proposer, choices available, result, total power cast, total voters and a list of all the voters that voted in this proposal showing the power cast by them and their choice and also the user can access any of the voters to see details from them.
